  Breakout

  This is a basic library that mimics the 1976 game, Breakout worked on by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs.
  The Breakout game had influenced Wozniak's design for the Apple II computer, including game paddle,
  color graphics circuitry, sound and graphics commands in BASIC.
  
  Instead of a hardware paddle this library uses the MPU6050 accelerometer for measuring roll & pitch,
  which are then mapped to 2D coordinates on the OLED display (so to move the paddle you rotate the PCB).
